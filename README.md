# UVSim - BasicML Virtual Machine

## üìñ Description
UVSim is a simulator for the **BasicML** machine language.  
It is designed to help computer science students learn machine language and computer architecture.  

The simulator includes:
- A **CPU**
- An **accumulator**
- **100 memory locations** (`00`‚Äì`99`)

Each word in memory is a signed four-digit decimal number (example: `+1234`, `-5678`).  
Programs are written in BasicML and must be loaded into memory starting at location `00` before execution.
