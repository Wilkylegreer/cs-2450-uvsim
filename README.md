# UVSim - BasicML Virtual Machine

## üìñ Description
UVSim is a simulator for the **BasicML** machine language.  
It is designed to help computer science students learn machine language and computer architecture.  

The simulator includes:
- A **CPU**
- An **accumulator**
- **100 memory locations** (`00`‚Äì`99`)

Each word in memory is a signed four-digit decimal number (example: `+1234`, `-5678`).  
Programs are written in BasicML and must be loaded into memory starting at location `00` before execution.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
- Python **3.8+**
- Command-line access

---

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.  
2. Run the simulator:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
3. Type in the file path (Example: test_files/Test6.txt) and watch the program run!
